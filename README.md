# BRL_US_Purchase_Power_Parity
Purchase Power Parity calculation for Brazil and US
The cumulative inflation in Brazil over the given period has reached 2.94381 or 294.38%. This indicates a significant increase in the overall price level in Brazil. On the other hand, the cumulative inflation in the United States stands at 1.62981 or 162.98%, suggesting a comparatively lower increase in prices in the US.

The exchange rate difference between the initial and current values of the BRL/USD rate is -43.62%. This negative value indicates a depreciation of the Brazilian Real against the US Dollar. Consequently, this implies that it takes more Brazilian Reals to buy one US Dollar compared to the initial period.

The purchasing power loss is calculated to be -128.41938. This represents a decrease in purchasing power due to the combined effect of inflation and the exchange rate difference. The negative value indicates a reduction in the ability to buy goods and services with the same amount of money.

The relative purchasing power parity, calculated as -0.06907, suggests a discrepancy between the exchange rate and the relative inflation rates. This indicates that the Brazilian Real may be overvalued relative to the US Dollar when considering the cumulative inflation rates.

The fair FX value for BRL/USD is determined to be 0.2687, indicating the estimated equilibrium exchange rate based on certain factors such as inflation differentials. Similarly, the fair FX value for USD/BRL is calculated to be 3.7216, which is the reciprocal of the BRL/USD fair value.

These values provide insights into the inflation rates, exchange rate dynamics, purchasing power, and relative value of the currencies. However, it's important to note that various factors can influence currency values, including economic indicators, market forces, and geopolitical events.
